# MVP ASR Architecture

The goal is to find the best architecture for the best ASR!

We want to reach: **Efficiency**, **Quickness** and **Frugality**!

Here is the model router architecture idea :

## Router
The goal is to create a Neural Network able to choose the n best models for a specific batch :

### Inputs :
#### The audio batch :
To link with the Neural Network, we can have some problemes : different resolutions and durations.

Different strategy is possible to solve it :
1. For the resolution :
- Choose a unique frequence (16 kHz) and resample all the audio to this value. But the router will learn some structural noize.

2. For the duration :
- Padding (shorter audio / add some 0 or noize) / Troncation (longer audio / cut) ==> simple but info lost / the duration are similar 
- Window cut (cut audio in fix frame with overlaps) ==> cut during a word ?
- Time/Frequency features (STFT, Log-Mel spectrogram, MFCC) to have a time * frequency image. ==> imposed a human vision + little info lost
- Global pooling (any cut) ==> crushed the temporal structure

My opinion : Log-Mel spectrogram + CNN + global or attention pulling and fixing the time of each batch with a big overlaps and make a ROVER during this timing  

#### Some metadata :
##### Needed :
- **SNR** (Signal-to-Noise Ratio)  
- **Duration** of the batch

##### Need to discuss with the group :
- **Languages** (if provided and see how to map)
- **Resolution** (8Hz (phones) to 44.1 kHz (studio)) ==> + or - robust models


##### Possible :
- **Bit Depth** : (ex: 16-bit, 24-bit) ==> sound dynamics
- **Field / theme** : (ex: medical, legal, conversation) ==> Simplify the process for the router
- **Duration** : be less energy-consumption (batch or total ?)


#### Idea for the overlaps
For the overlaps, I got an idea :

### Outputs


---

## Standardisation for each model

For each model, there is a `model_type_name.py` in the folder "models" (either an API or a local processing) that creates the standardised JSON as output.

For each model, make a function **"infer"** to compute the model and to create the output.

---

## Standardisation for the **JSON** output of an STT model

```bash
Batch :
- Batch ID (or the path + name)
- Info on the batch (language, total duration of the original audio, context…)
- Text transcription of the batch
- Timestamp for the start and the end of the batch

Model :
- ASR Model Name
- Size Model / Category
- Diarisation or not (bool) ==> Deleting or not "Speaker 0" for the WER test
- Compute duration
- Output: Text transcription of the model
```

- Distillation
- Quantization
- Zipformer
- Pruning
- Merging
- Steering
- Parallelization of the batch, frequency...
- Diarisation in parallel
